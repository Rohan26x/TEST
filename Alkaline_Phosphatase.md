# Alkaline Phosphatase

## Overview

- Alkaline phosphatase is a hydrolase enzyme responsible for removing phosphate groups from various molecules, including nucleotides, proteins, and alkaloids.
- The process of removing the phosphate group is called dephosphorylation.
- Alkaline phosphatases are most effective in an alkaline environment.

## Laboratory Uses

- Typical use in the lab includes removing phosphate monoester to prevent self-ligation.

## Common Alkaline Phosphatases Used in Research

- **Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP)**
  - Derived from a species of Arctic shrimp (Pandalus borealis).
  - Easily inactivated by heat, which is useful in some applications.
- **Calf-Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIP)**
- **Placental Alkaline Phosphatase (PLAP)**
  - Includes a C-terminally truncated version that lacks the last 24 amino acids, known as Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP).

## Importance in Molecular Biology

- Alkaline phosphatase is a useful tool in molecular biology laboratories.
- DNA normally possesses phosphate groups on the 5' end.
  - Removing these phosphates prevents DNA from ligating (the 5' end attaching to the 3' end), keeping DNA molecules linear until the next step of the process.
  - Removal of phosphate groups allows radiolabeling (replacement by radioactive phosphate groups) to measure the presence of labeled DNA.
