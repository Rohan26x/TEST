# M13 Vectors

## Overview

- M13, f1, and fd are filamentous coli phages containing a circular single-stranded DNA molecule.
- Phage particles have dimensions of 900 nm × 9 nm and contain a single-stranded circular DNA molecule, which is 6407 (M13).

## Why Use Single-Stranded Vectors?

- Sequencing
- Site-directed mutagenesis
- Probe preparation

## Why M13 Phage?

1. Phage DNA is replicated via a double-stranded circular DNA (RF) intermediate. This RF can be purified and manipulated in vitro just like a plasmid.
2. Both RF and single-stranded DNA will transfect competent E. coli cells to yield either plaques or infected colonies, depending on the assay method.
3. The size of the phage particle is governed by the size of the viral DNA, and therefore there are no packaging constraints.

## Development of Filamentous Phage Vectors

- Unlike λ, the filamentous coliphages do not have any non-essential genes which can be used as cloning sites.
- In M13, there is a 507 bp intergenic region, from position 5498 to 6005 of the DNA sequence, where foreign DNA has been inserted.
- Wild-type phages are not very promising as vectors because they contain very few unique sites within the intergenic region (AsuI and AvaI).
- The M13 genome is modified to construct a vector.

**Steps in Development**

1. **Modification of M13 Genome:**
   - 10 BsuI sites in the genome of M13, two of which are in the intergenic region.
   - M13 RF was partially digested with BsuI and linear full-length molecules isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis.
2. **Blunt-End Ligation:**
   - Linear monomers were blunt-end-ligated to a fragment comprising the E. coli lac regulatory region and the genetic information for the α-peptide of β-galactosidase.
3. **Transformation:**
   - Transform to a strain of E. coli with a deletion of the β-galactosidase α-fragment and recombinant phage detected by intragenic complementation on media containing IPTG and Xgal.
   - Virus is designated M13mp1.
4. **Detection of Recombinants:**
   - Insertion of DNA fragments into the lac region of M13mp1 destroys its ability to form blue plaques, making detection of recombinants easy.
   - The lac region only contains unique sites for AvaII, BglI, and PvuI, which are not common restriction sites, so a unique EcoRI site within the lac fragment was added. This variant was designated M13mp2.
5. **Further Modifications:**
   - Further modified to generate derivatives with polylinkers upstream of the lac α-fragment.
   - These derivatives (mp7–mp11, mp18, mp19) are the exact M13.
