# Yeast Artificial Chromosomes

## Key Components of a Chromosome

- **Centromere**
  - Required for correct distribution to daughter cells during cell division.
- **Telomeres**
  - Located at the ends of a chromosome.
  - Needed for correct replication.
  - Prevents the chromosome from being degraded by exonucleases.
- **Origins of Replication**
  - Positions along the chromosome where DNA replication initiates.

## Example: pYAC3

- **URA3 and TRP1**
  - Along with an origin of replication.
  - Includes CEN4, the DNA from the centromere region of chromosome 4.
  - (TRP1–origin–CEN4 fragment)
- **Telomeres**
  - Provided by two sequences called TEL.
- **SUP4**
  - Selectable marker into which new DNA is inserted during the cloning experiment.
  - Carried out by a simple color test:
    - White colonies are recombinants.
    - Red colonies are not.

## Applications of YAC

- Examine the segregation of chromosomes during meiosis.
- Able to clone genes larger than 100kb, e.g., cystic fibrosis gene (250kb).
- Used for genomic library construction.
- Gene expression studies are done using YAC.
