# DNA Polymerase

## DNA Polymerase I

- **Coded by polA gene**
- **Single polypeptide**
- **Cleaved with protease results into two fragments:**
  - Larger fragment (Klenow fragment)
    - Retains 5’ to 3’ polymerase activity
    - Retains 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity
  - Smaller fragment
    - Retains 5’ to 3’ exonuclease activity
- **Requires primer**
  - Provides 3’OH to add phosphodiester bond
- **Adds 600 nucleotides per minute**

## DNA Polymerase III

- **Subunits:**
  - Ten types of subunits
  - Polymerization subunit is α
  - Proofreading subunit is Є
  - Both α and Є associate with ϴ to form a core polymerase
- **Core polymerases linked to a clamp-loading complex (ϒ-complex):**
  - ϒ-complex consists of five subunits of four different types: Ʈ2, ɣ, δ, δ‘
  - Core polymerases are linked through Ʈ subunits
  - Two additional subunits (χ-chi and Ψ-psi) are bound to the clamp-loading complex
- **Entire assembly of 13 protein subunits (nine different types) is called DNA polymerase III**
- **Processivity:**
  - DNA polymerase III can polymerize DNA with low processivity
  - Addition of four β subunits completes the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme
  - Processivity increases dramatically to greater than 500,000

## DNA Polymerization Reaction

1. (dNMP)n + dNTP → (dNMP)n+1 + PPi
   - DNA lengthened
2. (dNMP)n + dNTP → (dNMP)n+1 + PPi
   - DNA lengthened
