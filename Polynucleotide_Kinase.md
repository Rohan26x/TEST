# Polynucleotide Kinase

## Overview

- Polynucleotide kinase (PNK) is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate from ATP to the 5' end of either DNA or RNA.
- It is a product of the T4 bacteriophage, and commercial preparations are usually products of the cloned phage gene expressed in E. coli.
- T4 PNK is a homotetramer of a 301 amino acid polypeptide.

## Enzymatic Activity

**Types of Reactions**

- **Forward Reaction**
  - PNK transfers the gamma phosphate from ATP to the 5' end of a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA).
  - The target nucleotide is lacking a 5' phosphate either because it has been dephosphorylated or has been synthesized chemically.
- **Exchange Reaction**
  - Target DNA or RNA that has a 5' phosphate is incubated with an excess of ADP.
  - PNK will first transfer the phosphate from the nucleic acid onto an ADP, forming ATP and leaving a dephosphorylated target.
  - PNK will then perform a forward reaction and transfer a phosphate from ATP onto the target nucleic acid.

## Indications for Phosphorylating Nucleic Acids

- **Phosphorylating linkers and adaptors, or fragments of DNA as a prelude to ligation**
  - This includes products of polymerase chain reaction, which are typically generated using non-phosphorylated primers.
- **Radiolabeling oligonucleotides, usually with 32P, for use as hybridization probes**

## Inhibition

- PNK is inhibited by small amounts of ammonium ions, so ammonium acetate should not be used to precipitate nucleic acids prior to phosphorylation.
- Low concentrations of phosphate ions, or NaCl concentrations greater than about 50mM, also inhibit this enzyme.

## Tasks

- [ ] Avoid using ammonium acetate to precipitate nucleic acids prior to phosphorylation.
- [ ] Ensure NaCl concentrations are less than 50mM when working with PNK.

## Summary

- PNK is crucial for transferring phosphates to the 5' end of DNA or RNA.
- It is used in forward and exchange reactions.
- Key applications include preparing DNA for ligation and radiolabeling oligonucleotides.
- Care must be taken to avoid inhibitors like ammonium ions and high concentrations of NaCl.
