# Plasmids

## General Information

- Plasmids are widely used as cloning vehicles.
- Plasmids are replicons which are stably inherited in an extra-chromosomal state.
- Most plasmids exist as double-stranded circular DNA molecules.
  - Covalently closed circles (CCC DNA): Both strands are intact circles.
  - Open circles (OC DNA): Only one strand is intact.
  - CCC DNA often has a supercoiled configuration due to a deficiency of turns in the double helix.
- Not all plasmids exist as circular molecules.
  - Linear plasmids have been found in various bacteria, e.g., Streptomyces sp.
  - To prevent nuclease digestion, the ends of linear plasmids are protected by:
    - Repeated sequences ending in a terminal DNA hairpin loop.
    - Covalent attachment of a protein.
- Plasmids are widely distributed throughout prokaryotes and vary in size from less than 1×10^6 daltons to greater than 200×10^6 daltons.

## Categories of Plasmids

- **Conjugative or Non-conjugative**:
  - Conjugative plasmids carry a set of transfer genes (tragenes) that promote bacterial conjugation.
- **Based on Copies per Cell**:
  - Relaxed plasmids: Multiple copies per cell.
  - Stringent plasmids: Limited number of copies per cell.
  - Generally, conjugative plasmids are of relatively high molecular weight and are present as one to three copies per cell.
  - Non-conjugative plasmids are of low molecular weight and present as multiple copies.

## Plasmids as Vectors

- **Advantages of Low Molecular Weight Plasmids**:
  - Easier to handle and more resistant to damage by shearing.
  - Readily isolated from host cells.
  - Usually present in multiple copies.
- **Features of Plasmid Vectors**:
  - Unique sites for a large number of restriction endonucleases.
  - Multiple marker genes.
  - Ability to confer readily selectable phenotypic traits on host cells.
  - These features are not seen in natural plasmids such as ColE1, RSF2124, pSC101.
  - Artificial plasmids are constructed using natural plasmids.

## pUC Vectors

- Incorporate a DNA sequence that permits rapid visual detection of an insert.
- The Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) is inserted into the lacZ′ sequence, which encodes the promoter and the α-peptide of β-galactosidase.
  - MCS or Polylinkers is a short DNA sequence carrying sites for many different restriction endonucleases.
  - Insertion of the MCS into the lacZ′ fragment does not affect the ability of the α-peptide to mediate complementation, but cloning DNA fragments into the MCS does.
  - Recombinants can be detected by blue/white screening on growth medium containing X-gal.
  - The usual site for insertion of the MCS is between the initiator ATG codon and codon 7, a region that encodes a functionally non-essential part of the α-complementation peptide.
