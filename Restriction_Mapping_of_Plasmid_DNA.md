# Restriction Mapping of Plasmid DNA

## Restriction Maps

- Restriction enzymes can be used to construct maps of plasmid DNA.
- Allows identification of restriction sites found in the sequence of the plasmid.
- Alternative means to discover DNA sequence without sequencing.
- Can be used to determine which restriction enzymes to use for recombinant techniques.

## Getting the Information

1. **Isolate the DNA**
2. **Digest it with restriction enzymes**
   - Breaks DNA into various size fragments.
3. **Sort fragments by size using gel electrophoresis**
   - Can sort DNA fragments differing by only a single nucleotide in length.
4. **Assemble map of relative positions**
   - Fragment lengths can be used to assemble the map.

## Digestion

- Can do single or multiple digestions.
  - Single digestion consists of only one enzyme in the mixture.
  - Multiple digestions include many or all the enzymes desired.
- Step-wise process gives the most information.
  1. Digest with individual enzymes.
  2. Include a multiple digestion.
  3. Use different sizes of the fragments to construct the map.

## Making the Map

1. **Stain and photograph the gel after running**
2. **Measure distances migrated by DNA fragments from the photograph of the gel**
3. **Produce a standard curve**
   - Plot distances migrated by ladder fragments against the size of the fragments.
   - Semilog graph paper must be used to obtain a linear plot.
4. **Determine fragment sizes of the digested plasmid DNA using the standard curve**
5. **Construct a circular map from the data**
